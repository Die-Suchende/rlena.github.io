    "text": "2 Look at the night sky, what do we see?\nLet’s start with some simple observations of the night sky… “Look at the night sky, what do we see?” Here in Scotland, the answer to this questions is likely ‘clouds’, but if you are curious to know what is beyond those clouds, you can check out Stellarium (you can download it or you can use the web version: https://stellarium-web.org/).\nAll that glitters is not (only) stars!\nLooking at the night sky we may be able to see planets, meteors, galaxies, satellites, comets, star clusters and many stars!\nA star is an astronomical spheroid body: - held together by self-gravity - radiating energy from an internal source (tipycally from nuclear fusion reactions, and occasionally from the release of gravitational potential energy during contraction or collapse)\nHaving this definition you should be able to answer this question: “is the Death Star a (fictional) star”?\nThe answer is “no”, because it does not radiate energy! The Death Star is actually a (fictional) space station orbiting the (fictional) planet moon of Endor. Enough with the fictional stuff now.\nIf you look at the sky you may see that planets and comets are also shining in the sky, so why can’t they be considered stars, based on the definition given above? Do they radiate energy? Are they self-gravitating?\nPlanets actually do not radiate, they mostly reflect the light coming from the Sun, and the same holds for comets. In addition to that, comets do not have enough mass to be considered self-gravitating objects.\nIf we try to answer this question based on our observations, we have to keep in mind that the apparent brightness of a light source will vary depending on its distance from the observer. The brightenss we observe is therefore not an intrinsic property of the stars, as it depends on the distance between the observer and the stars.\nThis is the reason why we need to differentiate between the apparent brightness of a star and its luminosity.\nLet’s look at how the spectrum changes with temperature \\(T\\).\nCode\nfor T in [6000,5500,5000,4500,4000]:\n    B_planck = 2*h.value*c.value**2 * (1.0/(np.exp(h.value*c.value/(k_B.value*T*(l*1e-9)))-1)) / (l*1e-9)**5\n    plt.plot(l, B_planck, label='T='+str(T)+'K')\n\nplt.xlabel(r'Wavelength $\\lambda$ (nm)')\nplt.ylabel(r'Spectral Radiance $B_\\lambda(\\lambda, T=4000K)$ (Wm$^{-3}$sr$^{-1}$)')\nplt.title('Spectral radiance at different temperatures')\nplt.grid()\nplt.legend();\nWe notice that the Planck spectrum - has a clear peak at some wavelength, which decreases as temperature increases - \\(B_\\lambda(\\lambda;T)&gt; 0\\) for all wavelengths, but tends toward \\(0\\) at the extreme ends of the spectrum - overall increases with temperature\nBlack bodies radiate at all wavelengths - they won’t look black! The shape of the spectrum and the position of the peak determines the apparent colour of the object.\nThe total (bolometric) luminosity per area (“radiant emittance” \\(j=\\frac{L}{A}\\)) has units of \\(\\mathrm{W\\,m}^{-2}\\), and is the spectral radiance integrated over solid angle and wavelength:\nThe equation for this is known as the Stefan-Boltzmann Law. \\[\\begin{align}\nj &= \\frac{\\pi^2 k_B^4 T^4}{60 \\hbar^3 c^2}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis can be written more simply as\n\\[\\begin{align}\nj = \\sigma T^4\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere \\(\\sigma = \\frac{\\pi^2 k_B^4 }{60 \\hbar^3 c^2} = 5.67\\times 10^{-8}\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}K^{-4}}\\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\nWe can multiply by the surface area to find the total luminosity of a spherical star of radius \\(R\\):\n\\[\\begin{align}\nL = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis is the most useful form to use in stellar calculations - remember it!\nIt allows us to relate \\(R\\), \\(L\\), and \\(T\\) for a star.\nYou need to be able to solve these types of problem - practice it!"

During its life it will evolve, changing its internal structure and chemical composition as it ‘burns its fuel’ and changing its mass and size, eventually resulting in its death when one of the conditions that define a star is no longer valid, i.e. when the star is no longer self-gravitating or when it stops radiating having exhausted its nuclear fuel. We will talk more about the evolution of stars in the following lectures. Now let’s go back to what we can observe having a look at the night sky and let’s see what we can tell from observations of stars."

    "text": "4.4 How do we measure the distance to the stars?\n\n4.4.1 The parallax method\nWe started with the easy example of answering how distant is the Sun, but what about other stars? One way to determine the distance to nearest stars is to use the parallax method.\nIf you look at the position of a closer object against a further background, you will notice that the image of the near object will shift in the background as you move. This effect is called parallax and you can experience it even when you close one eye at the time looking at an object against a background.\n\n\n\n\nParallax1\n\n\nAnalogously, in a background of distant stars, a closer star will appear to move against them as the Earth orbits the Sun. So how do we use this to determine the distance to a start? We use trigonometry.\nThe angle formed between the lines of sight of a star from two positions of the observer is twice the parallax angle. In the example below, the parallax is the angle between the lines of sight of the observer on Earth and from the Sun (the middle point between the position of Earth six months apart).\nThe number of stars that can be observed from Earth is limited and nowadays direct observations of the distance using the parallax method are done by satellites orbiting the Sun in sync with Earth. Hipparcos gathered data on more than one million stars, and its successor Gaia has already observed 2 billion stars!\n\n\n\n\nParallax and parsecs representation. Image readapted from: https://www.astronomy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/parsec.png\n\n\n\n\n\nThe parallax is generally measured in arcseconds (as). 1 arcsecond \\(= \\dfrac{1}{3600} \\deg = \\dfrac{1}{206,265}\\) radians. You can show these conversions by recalling that \\(1\\ \\rm{rad} = 57.3\\deg = (57.3\\times 60\\times 60)\\ \\rm{as}=206,265\\ \\rm{as}\\).\nThe parsec (parallax-second, pc) is defined as: \\[ 1\\ \\rm{parsec} = \\dfrac{1 au}{\\rm{arcsecond\\  in\\  radians}} = 206,265\\ au= \\dfrac{648000}{\\pi} \\rm{au} \\approx 3.086\\times 10^{16}\\rm{m}\\].\nA parallax of 1 arcsecond corresponds to a distance to the star of 1 parsec (3.26 light-years).\nUsing trigonometry, the distance \\(d\\) to the star is given by:\n\n\\[\n    d =\\dfrac{1 \\rm{au}}{\\tan p}\\simeq \\dfrac{1}{p} \\rm{au}\n\\] \\(\\qquad\\) where \\(p\\) is the parallax, and for this approximation we used \\(p\\) measured in radians. Converting the parallax \\(p\\) to \\(p''\\), from radians to arcseconds, we obtain the distance in parsec: \\[\n    d \\simeq\\dfrac{206,265 \\rm{au}}{p''}= \\dfrac{1}{p''} \\rm{pc}\n\\]\n\n\nCode\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\nAU = 149597870 # km\npc = 648000/np.pi*AU # km\nprint(f\"1parsec = {pc:1.3e} km\")\n\n\n1parsec = 3.086e+13 km\n\n\n\n\n4.4.2 The nearest star: Proxima Centauri\nThe further a star is, the smaller the parallax angle.\nThe nearest star (Proxima Centauri) has a parallax of 0.7681 arcseconds. This is very tiny, but still, we are able to measure it! To give you an idea of how small this is: - It is approximately the angle subtended by an object having a diameter of 2 centimeters, positioned at a distance of 5.3km! - The shift produced by the parallax against the background would be \\(1/2000^{th}\\) the width of the Full Moon!\nThe parallax method is covered in the ‘Observational Methods’ course, so this is just a taster, but now knowing the parallax of Proxima Centauri (or another star), we can find the distance to that.\n\n\nCode\n# The correct version\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\nimport math\nimport numpy as np\ndef arcsec_to_rad(p):\n    rad = p/206265\n    return rad\n\np = 0.7681 # as\nd_pc = 1/p # pc\n\np_rad = arcsec_to_rad(p)\nd_au = 1/p_rad # au\nd_km = d_au*AU # km\nprint(f\"p = {p} as\")\nprint(f\"d = 1/p pc = 1/{p} pc = {d_pc:1.1e} pc\")\nprint(f\"d = 1/p au = 20625/p au = 20625/{p} au = {d_au:1.1e} au\")\nprint(f\"d = {d_au:1.1e} au * 149597870 km = {d_km:1.1e} km\")\nprint(f\"The distance from Proxima Centauri is = {d_pc:1.1e} pc = {d_au:1.1e} au = {d_km:1.1e} km\")\n\n\np = 0.7681 as\nd = 1/p pc = 1/0.7681 pc = 1.3e+00 pc\nd = 1/p au = 20625/p au = 20625/0.7681 au = 2.7e+05 au\nd = 2.7e+05 au * 149597870 km = 4.0e+13 km\nThe distance from Proxima Centauri is = 1.3e+00 pc = 2.7e+05 au = 4.0e+13 km\n\n\n\n\n4.4.3 ‘Spot the mistake’ question:\nAn unknown star has a parallax of 379.21 mas.

Something was clearly wrong with the orders of magnitudes of the values obtained in the wrong solution: - the distance in pc can not be larger than the distance in au! Those orders of magnitude are clearly off! - if you compare this with the values obtained for Proxima Centauri, you should expect approximately the same orders of magnitude - \\(10^6\\) pc would be way too far to be able to use the parallax method to measure the distance: the most precise and reliable measurements of the parallax (with the Hubble Space Telescope and Gaia space mission), can measure distances of the order of \\(10^3\\rm{pc}\\).\n# The correct version\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\nimport math\n\np = 379.21/1000 # as &lt;- the units conversion was wrong\nd_pc = 1/p # pc &lt;- This formula for the distance in pc was swapped with the one below for the distance in au\n\nd_au = 206265/p # au &lt;-\n\nAU = 149597870 # km\nd_km = d_au*AU # km\nprint(f\"The distance to the star is = {d_pc:1.1e} pc = {d_au:1.1e} au = {d_km:1.1e} km\nThe distance to the star is = 2.6e+00 pc = 5.4e+05 au = 8.1e+13 km\n\n\nCode\n# The correct version\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\nimport math\n\np = 379.21/1000 # as &lt;- the units conversion was wrong\nd_pc = 1/p # pc &lt;- This formula for the distance in pc was swapped with the one below for the distance in au\n\nd_au = 206265/p # au\n\nAU = 149597870 # km\nd_km = d_au*AU # km\nprint(f\"The distance to the star is = {d_pc:1.1e} pc = {d_au:1.1e} au = {d_km:1.1e} km\")\n\n\nThe distance to the star is = 2.6e+00 pc = 5.4e+05 au = 8.1e+13 km"

    "text": "4.5 Transit method\n The parallax was also originally proposed as a way to determine the distance to the Sun by the Scottish astronomer James Gregory, in 1663, using the transit of Venus. Gregory is seldom given any credits for this idea and usually all the credits goes to Edmund Halley for some reason (can anyone find out why?).\nIn 1677, at the age of 20, Halley travelled to St Helena to map the Southern Skies and observed a transit of Mercury on November 7th. Like Gregory, he suggested that the transit of a planet like Venus could be used as a method to measure the distance to the Sun, using parallax.\nHere is the translation of Halley’s publication about this idea: https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/transit/HalleyParallax.html\n\n\n\n\n\nTransit Method\n\n\nAccording to ‘Halley’s method’, two observers (A and B in the figure above) have to be positioned at a great distance from each other, but both located on the side of Earth facing the Sun at the time of the transit. Each observer would precisely measure the times that Venus appear to be in different positions (contact points) relative to the Sun. The observers would see different chords of the planet’s trajectory across the disk of the sun due to parallax. Venus forms two similar triangles with the Earth and the Sun at their opposite edges. Since the triangles are similar, the projected distance on the Sun can be found by comparing it to a known baseline on Earth. Once the angle shift is measured, the distances to Venus and then to the Sun can be determined using trigonometry.\nModern techniques use radar echo ranging to measure distances in the Solar System very precisely."

    "section": "6.1 Apparent brightness and luminosity",
    "text": "6.1 Apparent brightness and luminosity\nThe apparent brightness, \\(F\\) (units [\\(\\rm{W/m}^2\\)]), also referred to as the radiant flux or power flux, is the total amount of energy emitted by a star, per unit time, crossing an unit area. It is not an intrinsic property of a star, because it depends on the distance from the star.\nThe following figure can give you a better understanding of that. Each square represents an unit area. The lightbulb, like a star, radiates equally in every direction (i.e. isotropically). The ‘rays’ coming out of the light source represent the flux. The farther the position of the observer is from the source, the less flux the observer, in one unit area, will receive. The relationship between the power flux, \\(F\\), and the distance to the source, \\(r\\), is given by the inverse square law: \\[F\\propto \\dfrac{1}{r^2}.\\] Since the light source radiates isotropically (even though the figure below shows only a portion of the rays), the power flux \\(F\\) is equal across all parts of the sphere.\n\n\n\nInverse square law of the radiant flux of a light source\n\n\nThe Luminosity of a star, \\(L\\), measured in Watts (W) or equivalently Joules per second (J/s), is its energy output per unit time. The luminosity is the total energy radiated in all the directions in an unit time and it does not depend on the distance from the observer: it is an intrinsic property of the star.\nHow are these two quantities related?\nImagine a sphere of radius \\(r\\) centered on a star, which is isotropically radiating. Since the power flux \\(F\\) is equal across all parts of the sphere and is the energy output, per unit time, crossing an unit area, we need to divide the luminosity equally over the area of the sphere, \\(4\\pi r^2\\). Therefore \\[\\begin{equation}\nF = \\frac{L}{4\\pi r^2}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe apparent brightness depends on the luminosity and on the distance of the observer from the star. From the formula above, you can see how two stars of equal luminosity, located at different distances from Earth, would have different apparent brightness.\nPhotometry is the measurement of the quantity of light from a star, i.e. the flux of energy per unit time, per unit area, that we receive at Earth.\nFor a particular star, if we know the luminosity (\\(L\\)) of the star and its distance from Earth (\\(r\\)) we can calculate the flux using the equation above.\n\n6.1.1 The Sun’s luminosity\nFor our Sun, we have:\n\\(F_\\odot = 1361\\, \\mathrm{W/m^2}\\) (The “Solar Constant”, or “Solar irradiance”, sometimes indicated with the symbol \\(S_\\odot\\) in textbooks)\n\\(r = 1\\, \\mathrm{a.u.} \\approx 1.5\\times 10^{11}\\, \\mathrm{m}\\)\nso\n\\(L_\\odot = 4\\pi r^2 F = 3.8275 \\times 10^{26}\\, \\mathrm{W}\\)\n\n\nCode\nimport scipy\nfrom scipy.constants import pi, au, parsec\n\nF = 1361.0 # W/m/m\nr = au # m\nL = F*4*pi*r**2\n\nprint(f'Power flux: F = {F} W/m/m')\nprint(f'r = 1au = {r:1.4e} m')\nprint(f'Luminosity: L =  F*4*pi*r**2 = {L:1.4e} W')\n\n\nPower flux: F = 1361.0 W/m/m\nr = 1au = 1.4960e+11 m\nLuminosity: L =  F*4*pi*r**2 = 3.8275e+26 W\n\n\nFor other stars there is a large range of luminosities:\n\\(10^{-4}\\,L_\\odot &lt; L &lt; 10^{6}\\,L_\\odot\\)\nIf we think of the least luminous star as a 100W incandescent lightbulb, this huge range tells us that the most luminous star would be like the entire world’s power output\nFuture question: Why is there this very large range?\n\n\n6.1.2 ‘Spot the mistake’ question\nWhat would the apparent brightness be for a star like the Sun at a distance of 10 pc? Something does not seem to make sense in the answer below, why?\n\n\nCode\n# This is the version containing a mistake\nL = 3.8275E26 # W\nr = 10 #pc\nF = L/(4*pi*r**2)\nprint(f'Solar luminosity = {L} W')\nprint(f'Distance r = {r} pc')\nprint(f'Apparent brightness of the Sun at 10 parsec: F = {F:1.4e} W/m/m')\n\n\nSolar luminosity = 3.8275e+26 W\nDistance r = 10 pc\nApparent brightness of the Sun at 10 parsec: F = 3.0458e+23 W/m/m\n\n\n# This is the version containing a mistake\nL = 3.8275E26 # W\nr = 10 #pc\nF = L/(4*pi*r**2)\nprint(f'Solar luminosity = {L} W')\nprint(f'Distance r = {r} pc')\nprint(f'Apparent brightness of the Sun at 10 parsec: F = {F} W/m/m')\n\nSolar luminosity = 3.8275e+26 W\nDistance r = 10 pc\nApparent brightness of the Sun at 10 parsec: F = 3.0458e+23 W/m/m\nDoes this make sense?\nHints\nHint 1: compare this apparent brightness obtained below with the value of the power flux used (the Solar constant) in the previous example. What is wrong?\nHint 2: Do a ‘sanity check’ of the units in the quantities used above. Does it seem correct?\nIf we compare this value obtained for the apparent brightness, \\(F=3.046\\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{W/m}^2\\), with the Solar constant used in the previous example, \\(F_\\odot = 1361 \\mathrm{W/m}^2\\), we can immediately notice that something is wrong. If we are observing the Sun from a further position of 10pc instead of 1au, we cannot expect it to appear brighter!\nLet’s do a dimensional analysis ‘sanity check’ by writing down the units of the quantities given above, and by replacing them in the formula to determine the flux from the luminosity: \\[ F=\\frac{L}{4\\pi r^2} \\implies [W/m^2] = \\frac{[W]}{[pc]^2} \\] This does not return an identity since \\([m]\\neq [pc]\\), so now we know where made a mistake, by just checking the units! To calculate the value of the flux correctly, you need to convert the distance from parsecs to meters, because the flux should be written in units of [\\(W/m^2\\)]!\n# Correct version\nimport scipy\nfrom scipy.constants import pi, parsec\n\nL = 3.8275E26 # W\nr = 10*parsec #pc\nF = L/(4*pi*r**2)\nprint(f'Solar luminosity = {L} W')\nprint(f'Distance r = 10 pc = {r:1.4e} m')\nprint(f'Apparent brightness of the Sun at 10 parsec: F = {F:1.4e} W/m/m')\n\nSolar luminosity = 3.8275e+26 W\nDistance r = 10 pc = 3.0857e+17 m\nApparent brightness of the Sun at 10 parsec: F = 3.1989e-10 W/m/m\n\n\nCode\n# Correct version\nimport scipy\nfrom scipy.constants import pi, parsec\n\nL = 3.8275E26 # W\nr = 10*parsec #pc\nF = L/(4*pi*r**2)\nprint(f'Solar luminosity = {L} W')\nprint(f'Distance r = 10 pc = {r:1.4e} m')\nprint(f'Apparent brightness of the Sun at 10 parsec: F = {F:1.4e} W/m/m')\n\n\nSolar luminosity = 3.8275e+26 W\nDistance r = 10 pc = 3.0857e+17 m\nApparent brightness of the Sun at 10 parsec: F = 3.1989e-10 W/m/m\n\n\nSanity checks\nGet the habit of doing ‘sanity checks’ of the dimensional analysis and units when you use or derive formulas. This will help you spot some mistakes quickly and is incredibly useful to rederive some formulas sometime. In the formula above for instance, we know that the apparent brightness \\(F\\) has units of [W/m \\(^2\\)] and that the luminosity \\(L\\) has units of [W]. Writing the units of each side of Equation (1) we see that: $ [W/m^2]=$, which as expected satisfies the identity, meaning that the formula is dimensionally correct."

    "text": "6.2 Stellar magnitude scales\nThe flux from even nearby stars is tiny, but many bright stars are distinguished by the naked eye. The human eye (like hearing) responds logarithmically to stimulus. When comparing the flux densities of three stars in a 1:10:100 ratio, the perceived brightness gap between the first and second star appears to be the same as the difference between the second and third star. This equality in perceived brightness gaps illustrates that human perception of brightness operates on a logarithmic scale. Therefore, before modern photometry, astronomers had a scale based on their own naked-eye observations: stellar (apparent) magnitude.\n\n6.2.1 Apparent magnitude\nThis system to measure the stars brightness was first introduced by the Greek astronomer Hipparchos, who compiled a catalog of 850 stars with their positions and their apparent magnitudes on a scale from \\(m=1\\), being the brightest stars, to \\(m=6\\), being the faintest stars. The apparent magnitude depends on the position of the observer the same way as the flux does (in fact, we will see in the following how these two quantities are related).\nThe image below shows an example of a star catalog created by ancient Greek astronomers.\n\n\n\nAlmagest\n\n\nAlmagest Ptolemy, c. 150AD image credit: Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris\nThe English translation reads\n\n\n\nAlmagest translated\n\n\nWe can still recognise the constellations and find these stars today!\n\nThe modern names and magnitudes for these stars are\n\n\n\nModern Name\nMagnitude\n\n\n\n\nPolaris\n1.98\n\n\nYildun\n4.35\n\n\n\\(\\epsilon\\) Umi\n4.21\n\n\nAlasco\n4.95\n\n\nAhfa al Farkadain\n4.29\n\n\nPherkad\n3.04\n\n\nKochab\n2.07\n\n\n\nImage credit: By IAU and Sky & Telescope magazine (Roger Sinnott & Rick Fienberg) - [1], CC BY 3.0, Link \nNote that some of the magnitudes of the little bear stars have changed since ancient times. Partly this is because the scientific definition and measurements are more precise, but also Polaris is a variable star (its brightness changes).\nThe apparent magnitude scale introduced by Hipparchos has been replaced by Pogson in 1856 and is no longer limited to values between 1 and 6, it now extends between m=-26.83 for the Sun to over m=30 for the faintest object, but the new classification kept these characteristics:\n\n5 magnitude steps correspond to a factor of 100 in apparent brightness\nA difference of 1 magnitude corresponds to an apparent brightness ratio of \\(100^{1/5}\\simeq 2.512\\), i.e. \\(\\dfrac{F_{m+1}}{F_m}=100^{1/5}\\)\nLower magnitudes are brighter\nThe zero point of the apparent magnitude has been conventionally determined\n\n\nThe apparent magnitude \\(m\\) is a measure of a star’s apparent brightness, i.e. the flux received from the star, and it therefore depends on how close the star is to the observer.\nThe definition of the apparent magnitude is based on the difference between magnitudes and corresponds to the ratio between two stars’ fluxes, as stated in the properties above.\nIf we consider two stars with measured fluxes (units \\(W/m^2\\)) \\(F_1\\) and \\(F_2\\), their apparent magnitudes will be related by\n\\[\\begin{align}\nm_1 - m_2 = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\frac{F_1}{F_2}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n6.2.1.1 Apparent magnitude zero point convention\nThe values of the apparent magnitudes are determined in relation to a zero point value \\(m=0\\). By convention, this corresponds to an observed flux of \\(F_0 = 2.518 × 10^{−8} \\ \\mathrm{W m}^{−2}\\). (Reference: IAU 2015 resolution)\nThe apparent magnitude of a star is therefore conventionally defined as\n\\[\\begin{align}\nm = -2.5 \\log_{10}{\\frac{F}{F_0}} = -2.5 \\log_{10}{F} - 18.997\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe apparent magnitude depends on the flux, and therefore on the intrinsic luminosity of the star and its distance (\\(r\\)) from Earth.\nUsing this zero point convention, from the nominal solar flux \\(F_\\odot = 1361 \\mathrm{W/m}^2\\), we can find that the apparent magnitude of the Sun is \\(m_\\odot=-26.382\\ \\mathrm{mag}\\).\n\n\n6.2.1.2  Question\nNote that the coefficient in the formula for the apparent magnitude is 2.5 and not 2.518! Why 2.5?\nHint:\nUse the properties of logarithms.\nSolution:\nBased on the characteristics of the apparent magnitude listed above, for two stars with apparent magnitudes \\(m\\) and \\(m+1\\), the ratio between the fluxes is \\(\\dfrac{F_{m+1}}{F_m}=100^{1/5}\\). How can we rewrite this in a form that explicitely shows the difference between the magnitudes, \\(m-(m+1)\\)?\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\dfrac{F_{m+1}}{F_m}=100^{1/5}=10^{2/5} &\\implies \\log_{10}{\\dfrac{F_{m+1}}{F_m}}=\\log_{10}{10^{2/5}}=\\frac{2}{5}\\log_{10}{10}=\\frac{2}{5} \\implies \\frac{5}{2}\\log_{10}{\\dfrac{F_{m+1}}{F_m}} = 1 = (m+1) - m \\\\\n&\\implies m-(m+1)=-2.5\\log_{10}{\\dfrac{F_m}{F_{m+1}}}\n\\end{align}\\]\nYou can see how from this derivation the factor 2.5 comes from the ratio 5/2 in the derivation of the formula for the apparent magnitude (see the first passage).\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Magnitude and units\nNote that the magnitude is dimensionless, so it does not have units (check this quickly doing dimensional analysis: on the right hand side you have the logarithm of a number, no units). However, to remind us that a value (e.g. \\(m=4.74\\)) is a magnitude, you can use the notation ‘mag’ after the numerical value (e.g. \\(m=4.74\\) mag).\nBeware confusing mass and magnitude!\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Absolute Magnitude\nAbsolute magnitude (M) is a measure solely of the star’s intrinsic luminosity \\(L\\), so it does not depend on its distance to the observer.\nIt is conventionally defined as the apparent magnitude of a star at a distance \\(r=10\\mathrm{pc}\\).\nTo define the zero point of the absolute magnitude (\\(M=0\\)), we use the same value of the flux, \\(F_0\\), used to define the apparent magnitude \\(m=0\\), and we find the corresponding luminosity \\(L_0\\) using Equation (1) for \\(r=10\\mathrm{pc}\\).\n\n\nCode\nfrom scipy.constants import pi, parsec\nf0 = 2.518021002E-8 # W/m/m\nr = 10*parsec # m\nL0 = 4*pi*r**2*f0 # W\nprint(f'r = 10 pc = {r:1.4e} m')\nprint(f'Conventional flux for zero apparent magnitude (m=0): F0={f0:1.4e} W/m/m')\nprint(f'Conventional luminosity for zero absolute magnitude (M=0): L0={L0:1.4e} W')\n\n\nr = 10 pc = 3.0857e+17 m\nConventional flux for zero apparent magnitude (m=0): F0=2.5180e-08 W/m/m\nConventional luminosity for zero absolute magnitude (M=0): L0=3.0128e+28 W\n\n\n\n6.2.3.1 Absolute magnitude zero point convention\nThe zero value of the absolute magnitude, \\(M=0\\), corresponds to a luminosity of \\[ L_0 = 4\\pi r^2 F_0 = 3.0128 \\times 10^{28} \\mathrm{W}.\\] (Reference: IAU 2015 resolution )\nPlugging Equation (1) into Equation (3), and considering that by definition the absolute magnitude is equal to the apparent magnitude at a distance \\(r=10\\mathrm{pc}\\), we can define the absolute magnitude as \\[\\begin{align}\nM = -2.5\\log_{10}{\\frac{L_1}{4\\pi r^2}\\frac{4 \\pi r^2}{L_0}} \\implies M = -2.5 \\log_{10}{\\frac{L_1}{L_0}} = -2.5\\log_{10} L_1 + 71.1974\n\\end{align}\\]\nUsing this convention, the absolute magnitude of the sun, having a nominal solar luminosity \\(L_\\odot = 3.828 \\times 10^{26} \\mathrm{W}\\), is \\(M_\\odot = 4.74\\mathrm{mag}.\\)\n(!) Caution: in different textbooks or sources (not updated to the IAU 2015 resolution), you may find different conventions for the zero points of apparent and absolute magnitudes. Consequently, you may have different values of the apparent and absolute magnitudes of the Sun (or other stars).\n\n\nCode\nfrom numpy import log10\nfrom astropy.constants import L_sun, L_bol0\n\nprint(L_sun)\nprint(L_bol0)\nL0 = 3.0128E28 # W\nM = -2.5*log10(L_sun/L_bol0)\nprint(f'Absolute magnitude of the Sun: M_sun = {M:.2f}')\n\n\n  Name   = Nominal solar luminosity\n  Value  = 3.828e+26\n  Uncertainty  = 0.0\n  Unit  = W\n  Reference = IAU 2015 Resolution B 3\n  Name   = Luminosity for absolute bolometric magnitude 0\n  Value  = 3.0128e+28\n  Uncertainty  = 0.0\n  Unit  = W\n  Reference = IAU 2015 Resolution B 2\nAbsolute magnitude of the Sun: M_sun = 4.74\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.4 Setting the Absolute Magnitude scale\nWe will need to convert magnitudes to S.I. units of luminosity. In some textbooks you may find that to define the absolute magnitude, the formula above is used, considering the Sun’s luminosity instead of the zero value \\(L_0\\) introduced above.\nSince the  IAU 2015 resolution, this definition is outdated, and the luminosity of a star, in Watts, can be defined using the zero point luminosity previously introduced, \\(L_0=3.0128\\times 10^{28}\\) W, as follows.\nFor a star with luminosity \\(L\\), the absolute bolometric magnitude \\(M\\) is given by \\[\\begin{equation}\nL = L_0 10^{-0.4 M}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n6.2.4.1 Example\nWe can use this formula to recover the luminosity of the Sun previously used, having the absolute magnitude of the Sun, \\(M_\\odot = 4.74\\). The constant 0.4 in the formula above is conveniently used to return the Sun’s luminosity \\(L_\\odot = 3.826 \\times 10^{26}\\rm{W}\\).\n\n\nCode\nfrom astropy.constants import L_bol0\n\nM_sun = 4.74\nprint(L_bol0)\nL = L_bol0*10**(-0.4*M_sun)\nprint(f'Luminosity of the Sun: L = {L:1.3e}')\n\n\n  Name   = Luminosity for absolute bolometric magnitude 0\n  Value  = 3.0128e+28\n  Uncertainty  = 0.0\n  Unit  = W\n  Reference = IAU 2015 Resolution B 2\nLuminosity of the Sun: L = 3.828e+26 W\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.5 Question\nShow that if we have two stars with luminosities (units \\(W\\)) \\(L_1\\) and \\(L_2\\) at the same distance \\(r=10\\rm{pc}\\), their difference in the apparent magnitudes is the same as the difference of the absolute magnitudes:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nM_1 - M_2 = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\frac{L_1}{L_2}\n\\end{align}\\]\nHint:\nUse the relationship between flux and luminosity and the properties of logarithms.\nSolution:\nFor two stars at the same distance \\(r\\) (e.g. two stars in a binary), we can write \\[\\begin{align}\nm_1 - m_2 &= -2.5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{L_1}{4\\pi r^2} \\times \\frac{4\\pi r^2}{L_2} \\right)\\\\\n&= -2.5\\log_{10}\\frac{L_1}{L_2}\n\\end{align}\\]\nHaving defined the absolute magnitude using the zero point flux above, for the i-th star (i.e. for i=1,2) with luminosities \\(L_i\\) at distances of 10pc, the absolute magnitude is: \\(M_i = -2.5 \\log_{10}{\\dfrac{L_i}{L_0}}\\)\nTherefore: \\[\\begin{align*}\nM_1 - M_2 & = -2.5 \\log_{10}{\\frac{L_1}{L_0}} - \\left(-2.5 \\log_{10}{\\frac{L_2}{L_0}}\\right) \\\\\n& = -2.5\\log_{10} L_1 - ( -2.5\\log_{10} L_0) - ( -2.5\\log_{10} L_2 - ( -2.5\\log_{10} L_0)) \\\\\n& = -2.5 \\log_{10} L_1 + 2.5 \\log_{10} L_2\\\\\n& = -2.5 \\log_{10}{\\frac{L_1}{L_2}}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nFor two stars at the same distance of 10pc from the observer, the difference in the apparent magnitude is equal to the difference in the absolute magnitude.\n\n\n\n6.2.6 Relationship between apparent magnitude and absolute magnitude\nBy using the conventional definitions of the apparent magnitude and absolute magnitude, we can find the relationship between them:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nm &= -2.5\\log_{10}{\\frac{F}{F_0}} \\\\\n&= -2.5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{L}{4\\pi r^2}\\times \\frac{4\\pi (10\\rm{pc})^2}{L_0} \\right) \\\\\n& =-2.5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{L}{L_0}\\right) -2.5\\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{10\\rm{pc}}{r}\\right)^2\\\\\n& = M -5\\log_{10}(10\\rm{pc})+5\\log_{10}{r}\\\\\n& = M -5 + 5\\log_{10}{r} \\implies \\\\\n\\implies M &= m + 5 - 5\\log_{10} r\n\\end{align}\\]\n(!) Careful to the units! Here \\(r\\) is measured in parsecs. Use this formula with caution!\n\n\n\n\n6.2.7 Magnitudes, luminosity and distance\n\nIf we know a star’s apparent magnitude \\(m\\) and know its absolute magnitude \\(M\\) you can calculate its distance \\(r\\) (in parsec!) using \\(M=m + 5 - 5\\log_{10} r\\).\nIf we know a star’s apparent magnitude and distance you can compute its luminosity\nYou should practice this type of conversion!\n\n\n\n6.2.8 Example\nA star with apparent magnitude \\(4.2\\) is measured by parallax to have a distance of \\(20\\) parsecs. What is the absolute magnitude?\n\n\nCode\nfrom numpy import log10\nm=4.2\nr=20 #pc\nM = m + 5 - 5*log10(r)\nprint(f'M = m + 5 - 5*log10(r) = {m} + 5 - log10({r})={m}+5{-log10(r)} = {M}')\nprint(f'Absolute magnitude is {M:.2f}')\n\n\nM = m + 5 - 5*log10(r) = 4.2 + 5 - log10(20)=4.2+5-1.3010299956639813 = 2.694850021680093\nAbsolute magnitude is 2.69\n\n\n\n\n6.2.9 Note on types of magnitude\nThe magnitude observed can depend on the sensitivity of the telescope or detector to the range of wavelengths. For instance, the human eye can observe in the visible part of the spectrum, but not in the IR or UV. Likewise, telescopes can have filters to observe different parts of the spectrum. Magnitude can therefore be specified for different wavelength intervals, i.e. observed with different coloured filters on the telescope. - For stars, the most commonly quoted magnitude is the visual magnitude, the magnitude in the visual part of the spectrum - Another commonly used magnitude is the bolometric magnitude, which includes the luminosity across the whole electromagnetic spectrum of wavelengths, whether observed or not. We will use this when performing some physics calculations.\nThe magnitudes we mentioned so far, e.g. \\(M_\\odot = 4.74\\) are bolometric magnitudes."

Lord Rayleigh used classical physics to predict the shape of the black body spectrum, this was later refined by Sir James Jeans.\nThe Rayleigh-Jeans law is a good approximation to the observed spectrum at long wavelength (low frequencies) \\(hc\\ll k_BT\\lambda\\).\n\\[\\begin{align}\nB_\\lambda^\\mathrm{RJ}(\\lambda; T) = \\frac{2ck_B T}{\\lambda^4}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n Lord Rayleigh (1842 - 1918)\n\n\n Sir James Jeans (1877 - 1946)\n\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nfrom astropy.constants import k_B, c, h\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import rc\nrc('text',usetex=True)\nrc('font',size=15)\nrc('figure',figsize=(8,6), dpi=300)\n\nl = np.linspace(0,3000,1000) # Wavelength, nm\nT = 4000 # Temperature, Kelvin\n\nB_rj=c.value* 2*k_B.value * T /(l*1e-9)**4 # 1e-9 to convert from nm to meters\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplt.plot(l, B_rj, label=\"Rayleigh-Jeans law\")\nplt.xlabel(r'Wavelength $\\lambda$ (nm)')\nplt.ylabel(r'Spectral Radiance $B_\\lambda(\\lambda, T=4000K)$ (Wm$^{-3}$sr$^{-1}$)')\nplt.title('Spectral radiance')\nplt.ylim([0,1e15])\nplt.grid()\nplt.legend();\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rayleigh-Jeans law has a big problem - the radiance keeps increasing indefinitely at short wavelengths (higher frequencies). If it were true the power emitted at short wavelengths would be infinite! This is known as the Ultraviolet Catastrophe, and indicates the failure of classical physics to explain the behaviour of thermal radiation.\n\n\n8.1.2 Wien’s law\nWien’s law is a good approximation to the observed spectrum at short wavelength (high frequencies) \\(hc\\gg k_BT\\lambda\\).\n\\[\\begin{align}\nB_\\lambda^\\mathrm{Wien}(\\lambda; T) = \\frac{2 hc^2}{\\lambda^5}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_B T}\\right)\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nCode\nB_wien=2 * h.value *c.value**2 * np.exp(-h.value*c.value/((l*1e-9)*k_B.value*T)) / (l*1e-9)**5;\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplt.plot(l, B_rj, label=\"Rayleigh-Jeans law\")\nplt.plot(l, B_wien, label=\"Wein's law\")\n\nplt.xlabel(r'Wavelength $\\lambda$ (nm)')\nplt.ylabel(r'Spectral Radiance $B_\\lambda(\\lambda, T=4000K)$ (Wm$^{-3}$sr$^{-1}$)')\nplt.title('Spectral radiance')\nplt.ylim([0,5e12])\nplt.grid()\nplt.legend();"

You are supposed to read the notes, complementing them with your own notes taken during the lectures and the book.\n\n\nIntroduction\nAstronomy is a observational science. We cannot bring a star down to Earth to study it in the laboratory. Unlike other branches of Physics, we cannot experiment directly on stars and what happens in the universe is beyond our control, but we can use our knowledge of Physics to make predictions and we can use observations to validate our theories. This can allow us to answer many questions about the stars. Some of these questions date back to the most ancient times, and through history have inspired philosophers and scientists to develop our understanding of the cosmos. This interplay between Astronomy and Physics is today called Astrophysics, which has grown to encompass phenomena from planets to galaxies to the evolution of the universe.\nAstrophysics is very multidisciplinary\n\n\n\nMultidisciplinarity in astrophysics\n\n\nAstrophysics is very multidisciplinary because of ‘several effects’ that come into play in the physics of stars, galaxies, the universe… it is an ‘arena’ of different fields of physics (but also mathematics and chemistry), spanning across classical mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, statistics, atomic and molecular physics, plasma physics, quantum mechanics and more (the list above and in the picture is not exhaustive)! In this course you will see how some of these fields play a role in the physics of stars."
